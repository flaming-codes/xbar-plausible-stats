# xbar-plausible-stats

A simple xbar-plugin to show how many users are currently on your site, tracked via Plausible.io.

This tool simply talks to the Plausible-API w/ the credentials you provide to retrieve the relevant data.

## Development

I also wrote [an article](https://flaming.codes/posts/writing-an-xbar-plugin-in-js-for-plausible-io) on my site about the development of Xbar-plugins.
